Twitter Binary Classification with MLs and NNs

The first project added to this portfolio concerns a binary classification problem, specifically, building ML and NN models that can predict the political affiliation (Democrat or Republican) of twitter users based on their tweets.

The motivation behind the creation of this independent project was to gain experience with three areas: 

1.	NLP techniques like Bag-of-words, TFIDF, GloVe, N-Grams, and POS (Part-Of-Speech) tagging.

2.	Building models for text data when represented as sparse matrices or vectors. 

3.	Using the Twitter API, Tweepy, which can be used to pull tweets using various criteria.
