Twitter Binary Classification with MLs and NNs

The first project added to this portfolio concerns a binary classification problem, specifically, building ML and NN models that can predict the political affiliation (Democrat or Republican) of twitter users based on their tweets.

The motivation behind the creation of this independent project was to gain experience with three areas: 

1.	NLP techniques like Bag-of-words, TFIDF, GloVe, N-Grams, and POS (Part-Of-Speech) tagging.

2.	Building models for text data when represented as sparse matrices or vectors. 

3.	Using the Twitter API, Tweepy, which can be used to pull tweets using various criteria.

Political Tweets - Data (and Sentiment) Analysis

The second project also uses the custom twitter objects to pull political tweets for the Gang of Eight (equal parts Democrat and Republican) so that we can assign sentiment to each and analyze the difference between groups of data.

The motivation behind the creation of this independent project was to gain experience with three areas:

1.	NLP techniques like Pre-Processing, Bag-of-words, etc.

2.	Feature engineering, including Sentiment using VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner).

3.	Explore and analyze the data using various types of visualizations, like word clouds and graphs.

4.	Perform statistical test to see if the difference in sentiment between two groups (Democrat and Republican) are statistically significant
